# LifeExpectancyPrediction
In this project, the aim was to predict life expectancy based on various factors, such as countries, developing status, GDP, adult mortality, BMI and other measurable factors. The file for dataset was collected from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) which keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries.
