# LifeExpectancyPrediction
In this project, the aim was to predict life expectancy based on various factors, such as countries, developing status, GDP, adult mortality, BMI and other measurable factors. The file for dataset was collected from the Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) which keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries.

The method applied in this project was the multiple linear regression. It was known that the dataset was indeed a 2938 x 19 matrix. The dataset was cleaned and normalized before the regression models were applied. Then, the dataset was split into 1/3 of testing data and the remaining as the training data. Each portion was plotted and was found that they produced almost similar results with accuracy about 70%.
